# SMART-ATTENDENCE-SYSTEM
The Smart Attendance System leverages Flask (Python) and OpenCV to automate attendance tracking using a webcam-based facial recognition system. It integrates machine learning (ML) algorithms to verify student identities against a secure database (MySQL/PostgreSQL) and enforce dress code compliance before marking attendance.
